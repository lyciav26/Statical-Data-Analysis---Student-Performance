# Statical-Data-Analysis---Student-Performance

This project is a comprehensive statistical data analysis of student performance in exams using R. 

üìÅ Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: Students Performance in Exams
It contains information on students' scores in math, reading, and writing, along with categorical variables such as gender, parental education, and lunch type.

The two quantitative variables I chose to focus on: math score and reading score, along with the categorical variable test preparation. These variables are highly relevant to both scores that are achieved by students. 

The main questions I aim to explore are: 
1. Do the descriptive statistics and graphical representations indicate that the 
variable follows a normal distribution, making it appropriate for further 
statistical analysis? 
2. Do students' scores in reading and math show a stable correlation across the 
dataset?

üéØ Objectives
The main objectives of the analysis are:

To examine the distribution and consistency of student scores.
To assess normality of data using statistical and graphical methods.
To analyze the correlation between math and reading scores.
To reflect on the use of statistical methods and visualizations.

üß™ Methods and Tools
This project was conducted using R programming for:

Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, SD, variance, range, IQR, CV)
Visualizations (histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, Q-Q plots)
Distributional analysis (Empirical Rule, Shapiro-Wilk test)
Correlation analysis (Pearson's r and r^2)

üìå Key Findings
Reading scores are more consistent (CV = 21.11%) than math scores (CV = 22.94%).
Math scores approximately follow a normal distribution (99.6% within 3 SD).
A strong positive correlation (r = 0.818) exists between math and reading scores.
Visualizations enhanced understanding of skewness, outliers, and distribution symmetry.
While correlation is strong, no causal relationship can be inferred.
